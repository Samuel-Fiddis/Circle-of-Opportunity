  <h1>The General Pot</h1>
  <p>Donations to the Circle of Opportunites General Pot are used to help
    students who are close to reaching their funding goal get up bumped to the
    amount they need to secure an oppotrunity to study as well as to help the
    Circle of Opportunity with their very minimal admin costs. Students have their
    funding automatically topped up with the students closest to reaching their goal
    being topped up first until the general pot is empty. This occurs when the
    deadline for getting funding is reached.
