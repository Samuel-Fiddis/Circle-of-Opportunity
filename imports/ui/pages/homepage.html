      The Circle of Opportunity is a non-profit organisation started at Imperial College London in 2017.
      Our aim is to cultivate a culture of investing in underprivledged students education with the expectation that they will one day re-invest themselves.<br>
      We do this by giving people the chance to choose who they invest in and
      insuring they understand where their money goes
      through the use of blockchain technology and the Ethereum cryptocurrency Ether.

      Donors fund the students they think are the most deserving of the opportunity to study or donate to the circle as a whole.
      Students sucsessfully selected are given funding for tuition and living expenses.
      When students find themselves in a comfortable position financially they begin to donate back.
      Once they have donated enough to fund one whole student they have come "full circle"!
      Further donations helps the circle expand.
      The whole system is financailly transparent through the use of blockchain so you know where your money is going.
