    <h1>The Circle of Opportunity</h1>
    <p>Creating Opportunities Block by Block.</p>
      <p>
        The Circle of Opportunity is a non-profit organisation started at Imperial College London in 2017.
        Our aim is to cultivate a culture of investing in underprivledged students education with the expectation that they will one day re-invest themselves.<br>
        We do this by giving people the chance to choose who they invest in and
        insuring they understand where their money goes
        through the use of blockchain technology and the Ethereum cryptocurrency Ether.
      </p>
    <h1>How It Works</h1>
    <p>
      Donors fund the students they think are the most deserving of the opportunity to study or donate to the circle as a whole.
      Students sucsessfully selected are given funding for tuition and living expenses.
      When students find themselves in a comfortable position financially they begin to donate back.
      Once they have donated enough to fund one whole student they have come "full circle"!
      Further donations helps the circle expand.
      The whole system is financailly transparent through the use of blockchain so you know where your money is going.

        <h1>How to Donate</h1>
        <p>
         To keep the financial side of things transparent we ask you
         to first transfer or purchase the amount of ether you would
         like to donate to the students or to the Circle of Opportunity
         into your Circle of Opportunity controlled account*

         {{#if currentUser}}
         which has the public key:
         <br><br>
                        {{publicKey.ethereum}}
         <br><br>
         {{else}}
         please <a href="/donorregister">register as a donor</a> to have an account set up for you.
         {{/if}}
        *Please note that once these funds have been transferred they
        cannot be returned and can only be used to sponsor a student or
        be donated to the Circle of Opportunity.

        </p>

        <h1>Getting Ether to Your Account</h1>
        <p>
        If you already have an Ethereum wallet you can simply transfer the funds into your circle of opportunity account.<br><br>
        If you have Bitcoin or any other form of cryptocurrency you can convert this to Ethereum through sites such as <a href="https://shapeshift.io">Shapeshift</a>.<br><br>
        If Ethereum is your first cryptocurrency then you will have to set up an Ethereum wallet and buy some Ether! Ethereum is an emerging and fast growing cryptocurrency so now is the best possible time to get acquainted with it and itâ€™s really quite simple. To have an Ethereum wallet set up for you and to buy some Ether, we recommend using <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>.<br><br>
