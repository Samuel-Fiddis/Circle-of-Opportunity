        <h2>How to Donate</h2>
        <p>
         To keep the financial side of things transparent we ask you
         to first transfer or purchase the amount of ether you would
         like to donate to the students or to the Circle of Opportunity
         into your Circle of Opportunity controlled account*

         {{#if currentUser}}
         which has the public key:
         <br><br>
                        {{publicKey.ethereum}}
         <br><br>
         {{else}}
         please <a href="/donorregister">register as a donor</a> to have an account set up for you.
         {{/if}}
        *Please note that once these funds have been transferred they
        cannot be returned and can only be used to sponsor a student or
        be donated to the Circle of Opportunity.
